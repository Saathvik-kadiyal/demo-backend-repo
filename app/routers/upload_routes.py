Excel upload and correction API routes.

This module provides API endpoints to:
- Upload Excel files containing employee shift data.
- Download generated error Excel files for invalid records.
- Submit corrected rows to update previously failed records.

All endpoints are secured and require authentication.
Temporary files are managed through a shared upload service.
